## Problem
# You want to create a set of API documentation for your application.
## You might want to go so far as to keep all your documentation in the same files as your source code.

## Solution
## It’s good programming practice to preface each of your methods, classes, and modules with a comment
## that lets the reader know what’s going on. Ruby rewards this behavior by making it easy to transform
## those comments into a set of HTML pages that document your code.
